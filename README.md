# Talks

PDF files of presentations I have given across the course of my PhD

## Descriptions

* [*Predicting Inflammatory Bowel Disease Outcomes*](3MT.pdf) is a 3 minute
  thesis style talk I gave for an event organised by the post-graduate society
  at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer
  [(POGS)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-genetics-cancer/igc-graduate-research-and-training/information/student-information/life-at-the-institute/committees-societies-and-groups).
  This presentation discussed IBD, and performing longitudinal survival analysis
  using either landmarking or joint models.
* [*Introduction to Survival Analysis and Cox Proportional Hazards Models*](DECOVID.pdf)
  is a talk I gave whilst working on [DECOVID](https://decovid.org/). This is a
  fairly advanced introduction to Cox proportional hazards models intended for
  PhD students and post docs in fields such as Machine Learning and non-Medical
  Statistics.  
* [*Predicting Loss of Christmas Cheer in Xmas Elves*](Xmas-talk.pdf) is
  (unsurprisingly) a Christmas-themed talk which I gave to students and staff
  from the
  [MRC Human Genetics Unit](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit). This
  talk covered shared random effects joint models and joint latent class models.
* [*How Do You Carry Out Survival Analysis?*](igmm-stats-seminar.pdf) was an
  installment of the Institute of Genetics and Cancer's 
  Statistical Seminar Series which introduced/recapped statistical concepts to 
  biologists at the IGC. Whilst Less in-depth than my DECOVID talk, this 
  presentation covers a much wider range of topics including Kaplan-Meier, Cox
  proportional-hazards, accelerated failure time models, competing risks
  survival analysis and joint modelling of time to event and longitudinal
  outcomes. [Code](https://github.com/nathansam/igmm-survival) was also  made
  available demonstrating how to apply these methods. 
* [Latent Crohnâ€™s Disease Subgroups are Identified by Longitudinal Biomarker Profiles](Precision-Medicine.pdf)
  was given to other third-year Precision Medicine doctoral training programme
  students. This talk discussed my
  [manuscript of the same name](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.16.22278320).
